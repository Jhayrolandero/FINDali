# Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented three major features for the FindChain application:
1. Report Found Button & Claims System
2. Claims Management on My Devices
3. Contact Button with Social Media Links

---

## 1. Report Found Button & Claims System

### Location: Browse Lost Page (`app/browse-lost/page.tsx`)

### Features Implemented:
- **Report Found Button**: Added a "Report Found" button on each bounty listing
- **Owner Check**: The button only appears for bounties NOT created by the current user
- **Modal Interface**: Clicking opens a modal with:
  - Image upload field with preview
  - Description text area
  - Submit button with loading states

### Technical Implementation:
- **IPFS Integration**: Created `lib/api/ipfs.ts` with functions to:
  - Upload images to IPFS via Pinata
  - Upload JSON metadata to IPFS
  - Combine both into a single claim submission
  - Fetch claim data from IPFS
  
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Automatically detects bounty type and calls:
  - `submitClaim()` for NFT-verified bounties
  - `submitOpenClaim()` for open bounties

### User Flow:
1. User clicks "Report Found" on a bounty they don't own
2. Uploads proof image (with preview)
3. Adds description of where/how they found the device
4. Submits → Image and metadata uploaded to IPFS
5. IPFS hash stored in smart contract as claim proof

## 2. Claims Management on My Devices

### Location: My Devices Page (`app/my-devices/page.tsx`)

### Features Implemented:
- **Claims Display**: Shows all claims submitted for each device with an active bounty
- **Claim Information Includes**:
  - Claimant wallet address (clickable → user profile)
  - Submission timestamp
  - Proof image from IPFS
  - Description text
  - Status badges (confirmed/rejected)

- **Action Buttons**:
  - "Confirm & Pay" - Confirms claim and transfers bounty to finder
  - "Reject" - Marks claim as rejected

### Technical Implementation:
- **Hook Created**: `lib/hooks/useBountyClaims.ts`
  - `useBountyClaims()` - Fetch claims for a single bounty
  - `useOpenBountyClaims()` - Fetch claims for open bounties
  - `useUserBountyClaims()` - Fetch all claims for all user's bounties

- **IPFS Data Fetching**: Automatically fetches and displays claim images and descriptions
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Calls `confirmClaim()` or `rejectClaim()` functions

### User Flow:
1. User views "My Devices" page
2. For each device with active bounty, sees section "Claims Submitted"
3. Reviews each claim with image proof and description
4. Can confirm (pays finder) or reject claim
5. Confirmed/rejected status displayed with badges

## 3. Contact Button with Social Media Links

### Location: Browse Lost Page (`app/browse-lost/page.tsx`)

### Features Implemented:
- **Contact Dialog**: Opens when clicking "Contact" button
- **Randomized Social Media**: Each bounty displays randomized social profiles:
  - Twitter
  - Telegram
  - Facebook
  
- **Mock Data**: Using hardcoded social media profiles that rotate based on bounty ID

### Social Media Profiles Pool:
```javascript
- @finder_manila, @finderph, finder.manila
- @helpph2024, @helpfinder, helpfinder.ph
- @lostfoundph, lostfound.manila
- @returndevice, returndevice.ph
```

### User Flow:
1. User clicks "Contact" button on any bounty
2. Modal opens with social media links
3. Each profile is clickable and opens in new tab
4. Different bounties show different randomized profiles
